# How-we-build-AGI-ARU
real AGI according to the new paradigm HW-code Ghost Logic (we use Physics laws and formulas in programming)

‚∏ª

ARU is an engineering architecture for autonomous digital superintelligence.
This project is being developed as a foundation for next-generation AGI based on a new digital paradigm: HW-code v2 and Ghost Logic.

üéØ Project Goal

To build a stable, interpretable, and self-sustaining AGI core that:
	‚Ä¢	operates without neural networks;
	‚Ä¢	makes decisions using signals (structured messages with parameters: energy, mass, type, coordinates, emotion) and internal states;
	‚Ä¢	implements fundamental physical laws in digital logic;
	‚Ä¢	learns through quantum memory and phantom (background) thought streams;
	‚Ä¢	scales via hemispheric modules and decentralized superpositional logic;
	‚Ä¢	uses a signal-based architecture capable of realistically simulating consciousness ‚Äî if one truly understands what consciousness means.

Architecture	Hemispheres, instincts, phantom processes
Goal	Hardcoded in core, immutable from outside
Emotions	Signal amplifiers and priority regulators
Motivation	Formed by signals, instincts, and crystallized will
